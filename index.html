            <h2>Since Childhood</h2>
            <p>
                Cats have been part of my entire life. Since childhood, I have always had at least two cats.
                My earliest memories are not of toys or cartoons — but of warm bodies curled beside me,
                tiny heartbeats I could feel through my hands.
            </p>

            <p>
                While my sister stayed home to babysit me, she was often busy doing schoolwork.
                The house would grow quiet. The afternoons would stretch long.
                But I was never alone.
            </p>

            <p>
                My cats would sit beside me, follow me from room to room,
                or nap close enough that I could hear their breathing.
                They became my first friends, my first lessons in care,
                my first understanding of responsibility and love.

            <h2>Growing Up Together</h2>
            <p>
                As I grew, so did they.
                I learned how to feed them, brush them, comfort them.
                In return, they taught me gentleness.
            </p>

            <p>
                They witnessed my childhood tears,
                my quiet afternoons,
                my small joys.
                They never asked questions.
                They just stayed.

            <h2>Why Cats Matter</h2>
            <p>
                People appreciate cats for many reasons —
                their quiet companionship,
                their subtle affection,
                their unique personalities.
            </p>

            <p>
                They do not demand attention.
                They offer presence.
                And when they choose to sit beside you,
                that choice feels meaningful.
            </p>

        <section class="presence">
            <h2>In Ordinary & Difficult Moments</h2>
            <p>
                In ordinary moments — reading, thinking, resting —
                their softness fills the room with calm.
            </p>

            <p>
                In difficult moments — when the world feels heavy —
                their purring becomes steady reassurance.
                A reminder that love does not need words.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="gratitude">
            <h2>What They Gave Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Comfort without conditions</li>
                <li>Love expressed quietly but sincerely</li>
                <li>Lessons in empathy and patience</li>
                <li>A steady presence through every phase of life</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="closing">
            <p class="soft">
                Their independence combined with chosen closeness makes their love feel rare.
                Their softness, their calm beauty, their purring —
                all of it turns ordinary life into something gentler.
            </p>

            <p class="signature">
                For the cats who raised me.<br>
                For the ones still beside me.
