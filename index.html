            <h2>How Cats Have Shaped My Life</h2>
            <p>
                Cats have been a part of my entire life. Since childhood, I've always had at least two cats, so most of my attachments come from my earliest memories of cuddling and caring for them. While my sister would stay home to babysit me, she'd always be busy doing her school work, so my cats always kept me company.
